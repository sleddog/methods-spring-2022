# Final Project: GitHub Actions and Unit Tests

For my final project I added a few tests and a github workflow to automatically run the test suite for the repo that I use for my Capstone project and for research. 
Currently the tests pass locally but because of some path issues the tests won't pass on a linux machine. In the future I will resolve this by implenting PathLib.
