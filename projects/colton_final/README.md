# Final Project

For my final project I chose to dockerize a simple Python script that pulls from a public weather API.

The link to my DockerHub that contains the Docker image is: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/cweedster1/python-img

From here you can pull the image down to your machine
Run the image with the command
~~~
docker run -ti python-img
~~~
You will have to make sure and use ti '-ti' tag to make sure that the application runs in interactive mode or else it will not work.
