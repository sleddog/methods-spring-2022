# FizzBuzz solution script
### Author: Chris Danielson

**Description**

The script named *run.sh* runs a script that will run the fizz.py file that solves fizzbuzz.

**Directions**

I used git bash to run the shell script

1. Make sure you have *run.sh* in your current working directory.

2. In the command line, type *./run.sh x* where x is the number you want to use for FizzBuzz.

3. The solution should print momentarily after you enter this command. Yay.
