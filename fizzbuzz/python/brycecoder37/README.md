**Description**

The script named *assignment3.sh* contains python code that solves the FizzBuzz problem.

**Directions**

1. Make sure you have *assignment3.sh* in your current working directory.

2. In the command line, type *./assignment3.sh x* where x is the number you want to use for FizzBuzz.

3. The solution should print momentarily after you enter this command. Yay.
