**Description**

The script named *fizzbuzz.sh* contains python code that solves the FizzBuzz problem.

**Directions**

1. Make sure you're current working directory is the directory: */fizzbuzz/python/brycecoder37*.

2. In the command line, type *./fizzbuzz.sh x* where x is the number you want to use for FizzBuzz.

3. The solution should print momentarily after you enter this command. Yay.
