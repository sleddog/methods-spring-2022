    <p>Hey there! My name is Sierra and I am a senior studying Computer Science
        at Montana State University. I am originally from Eastern California and grew up
        in the Sierra Nevadas. In the photo above you can see myself and my childhood pup, Kenai.
        I currently am working as an intern at Brightvine. In my free time I love everything
        from fishing, bonfires, powerlifting and reading!
