	<title>Methods 2022 - Students - Logan Dolechek</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Logan Dolechek</h1> 
	<p>My name is Logan Dolechek and I am a Senior studying Computer Science.
	I was born in Bozeman, MT but I grew up in Kalispell, MT. I am a non-traditional
	student. I started my undergraduate right before I turned 23 at Flathead Valley
	Community College. I then transfered to Bozeman, MT to continue my degree about
	a year and a half later. I am currently looking for interneships for the summer
	of 2022. I will be graduating in the fall of 2022 and I'm not fully sure where
	I want to end up after that. In my free time I like to fish, hunt, hike, and go
	camping. If I'm not getting out and about I like to watch TV shows/Movies or
	unwind with some racing games. I grew up in a drag racing family so I have an 
	unhealthy relationship with horsepower, nitrous, and boost. At the moment my uncle
	and I are wrapping up a rebuild of my dads old car. A 1970 Plymouth Duster. Our 
	goal is to make it a 9 second quarter-mile car. It should be making its first
	passes summer of 2022. As Dom said in the movie Fast and the Furious "I live my 
	life a quarter mile at a time. Nothing else matters: not the morgage, not the
	store, not my team and all their bulls**t. For those ten seconds or less, I'm free."
